1. Grasping the basics of swing
    To understand the main principles of swing I decided to ask AI chat bot (ChatGPT and Claude) to be my tutor.
    No code just main ideas of swing and game desing in swing.
    What I have learned: 
        EDT (event dispatching thread) insted of repeating actions in a loop we schedule them for execution with Timer class
        How does paint and repaing work - we always pass Graphics object, the "painting brush" given by swing - the ability to
            make graphics, but controlled by swing - so when it is setVisible swing takes care of it
        Separating game objects and game logics from rendering objects
        Player input - using key binds instead of key listeners: works even if the component is not focused. InputMap, ActionMap


2. Tiles, and moving the background
    We have a matrix of tiles
    We want to display tiles around player and move them on player input



3. HANNA'S LECTURE
    Game class is the PUPET MASTER
    Separate DATA (MODEL) from LOGIC (physics/collision) and RENDERING
    MINIMAL COLLECTION INTERFACE - use the least sufficient interface
    dependenci INJECTION - let the pupet master decide how to use classes

My implementation
    I have to clearly separate LOGIC and RENDERING and MODEL
    MODEL - tilemap, world offset >> GamePanel
    LOGIC - changing world offset based on input (if possible) ->> changing model >> GameEngine
    RENDERING - based on MODEL, renders visual rep.
